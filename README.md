## Description
This research proposes a driver drowsiness detection based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect drowsiness. The parameters of Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) are used to determine the class. There are three classes trained using CNN to identify driver patterns, such as ’sleepy and yawning’, ’sleepy not yawning’ and ’yawning not sleepy’. The three classes are a combination of EAR & MAR parameters. The results show that this model is able to detect drowsiness with high accuracy. In this study, the best results were obtained by using the parameters learning rate 0.0001, activation ReLU and Optimizer SGD. With model performance for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score of respectively 91.76%, 91.76%, 92.94%, and 91.62%, respectively.
